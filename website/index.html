        Oil spills pose a severe threat to marine ecosystems, coastal economies, and environmental sustainability.
         These spills contaminate water, endanger marine life, and disrupt industries such as fishing and tourism. 
         Traditional oil spill detection methods are often slow, expensive, and ineffective in identifying and tracking spills in real time. 
         The need for an advanced, automated detection system has become more critical than ever. 
         This project introduces an AI-driven oil spill detection system that combines deep learning, satellite imagery, and AIS vessel tracking to enable real-time monitoring and rapid response. 
         By utilizing advanced models such as UNET and DeepLabV3+, the system ensures precise segmentation and detection of oil spills, minimizing false positives and enhancing detection accuracy. 
         The integration of vessel tracking data further helps in identifying potential sources of pollution, aiding in maritime law enforcement and environmental protection efforts. 
         Additionally, real-time data processing reduces the delay in spill detection, allowing authorities to take swift action. 
         The system's adaptability ensures that it can be deployed across various marine environments, making it a scalable and efficient solution to combat oil spills globally. With a focus on real-time processing, visualization, and automated alerts, 
         this system provides an innovative solution to one of the most pressing environmental challenges. By leveraging artificial intelligence, 
         we aim to revolutionize oil spill detection, improve response efficiency, and contribute to the preservation of marine ecosystems.

        Effects of Oil Spill
    </div>

    <div class="content">
    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Environmental Damage</h2>
            <p>Oil spills create a toxic environment for marine organisms. Oil coats marine animals, making it difficult for them to move, hunt, or escape predators. It also contaminates water, reducing oxygen levels and severely harming coral reefs. The disruption of marine habitats affects biodiversity, leading to long-term ecological imbalances. In addition, the chemical components of oil persist in the ecosystem, causing chronic pollution that severely impacts delicate marine food chains.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Threat to Marine Life</h2>
            <p>Fish and shellfish suffer from poisoned habitats, leading to mass die-offs. Sea birds lose their waterproofing, making them vulnerable to hypothermia. Mammals like whales and dolphins struggle with respiratory damage caused by toxic oil fumes. Prolonged exposure to heavily contaminated waters weakens immune systems, making marine species more susceptible to deadly diseases and infections.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Long-Term Ecosystem Disruption</h2>
            <p>Oil spills cause long-lasting damage to marine ecosystems. Toxic chemicals remain in the ocean for decades, leading to mutations, reduced reproduction rates, and population declines in various species. Oil settles on the ocean floor, contaminating sediments and affecting deep-sea organisms that are essential for maintaining ecological balance.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Economic Loss</h2>
            <p>Local fishing communities face major losses due to contaminated seafood. Tourism declines as oil-coated beaches drive visitors away. Cleaning up an oil spill is also expensive, costing governments billions of dollars. The economic impact extends to shipping, as oil-contaminated waters disrupt trade routes and increase transportation costs.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Health Hazards for Humans</h2>
            <p>Oil spills release toxic fumes that cause respiratory problems, dizziness, and headaches in humans. Direct skin contact with oil can lead to severe burns, rashes, and long-term health issues. Inhalation of hazardous chemicals such as benzene and toluene can lead to neurological disorders and increased cancer risks among affected populations.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Impact on Coastal Infrastructure</h2>
            <p>Oil spills not only affect marine life but also severely damage coastal infrastructure. Ports, harbors, and desalination plants suffer significant operational disruptions due to oil contamination. Extensive cleanup operations often require shutting down these facilities, leading to major delays in trade and severe water shortages in affected areas.</p>
