# Real-Time Oil Spill Detection Using AIS and Satellite Data Integration

[cite\_start]An automated, intelligent framework for real-time maritime surveillance, combining deep learning models with vessel tracking data to detect and report oil spills[cite: 1, 153].

## üåü Project Overview

[cite\_start]This project presents a comprehensive solution to a critical environmental challenge: oil spills[cite: 152, 153]. [cite\_start]Traditional detection methods are often slow and ineffective[cite: 181]. [cite\_start]Our system addresses these limitations by leveraging a powerful combination of technologies to provide **real-time, accurate, and automated oil spill detection** and identification of the responsible vessels[cite: 158, 300].

We integrate two primary data sources:

  * [cite\_start]**Automatic Identification System (AIS) Data:** Provides real-time vessel movement, speed, and location data[cite: 154, 183]. [cite\_start]Anomalies in this data, like sudden speed drops or erratic navigation, can indicate potential spills[cite: 156].
  * [cite\_start]**High-Resolution Satellite Imagery:** We use images from **Sentinel-1 (Synthetic Aperture Radar - SAR)** and **Sentinel-2** satellites, which are ideal for detecting oil slicks on the ocean surface, even in challenging weather conditions[cite: 154, 183, 306, 307].

[cite\_start]By fusing these data streams, our system not only detects spills but also correlates them with nearby vessel activities, a crucial step for environmental enforcement and accountability[cite: 158, 160, 313].

## ‚ú® Key Features

  * [cite\_start]**Real-Time Anomaly Detection:** The system continuously monitors AIS data to flag suspicious vessel behavior that may lead to an oil spill[cite: 156, 303, 304].
  * [cite\_start]**Hybrid AI Model:** A custom-trained deep learning model, combining the strengths of **U-Net** and **DeepLabV3+** architectures, is used for precise image segmentation and spill detection[cite: 185, 246].
      * [cite\_start]U-Net is proficient in capturing fine-grained edges and preserving spatial integrity[cite: 248].
      * [cite\_start]DeepLabV3+ excels at understanding the broader context and reducing classification errors[cite: 248].
  * [cite\_start]**Data Integration & Correlation:** The integration of AIS and satellite data significantly improves the accuracy, speed, and reliability of oil spill detection[cite: 158].
  * [cite\_start]**Automated Alerts & Reporting:** The system provides real-time alerts and generates visual reports with vessel identity, location coordinates, and time[cite: 160, 314, 315, 317].
  * [cite\_start]**Scalable Architecture:** The scalable nature of the system allows for integration with meteorological data and supports large-scale deployment by using cloud platforms like Google Earth Engine[cite: 162, 332].

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

  * [cite\_start]**AIS Data Ingestion:** The system monitors real-time AIS data to track vessel movements[cite: 154].
  * [cite\_start]**Anomaly Detection:** Machine learning algorithms are applied to detect abnormal vessel behavior, such as abrupt speed reductions or erratic navigation[cite: 156].
  * [cite\_start]**Satellite Image Retrieval:** Upon detecting an anomaly, the system fetches corresponding Sentinel-1/Sentinel-2 imagery from Google Earth Engine (GEE)[cite: 306].
  * [cite\_start]**Deep Learning Analysis:** A custom-trained hybrid deep learning model processes the satellite image using advanced image analysis techniques, including segmentation and classification, to pinpoint suspicious surface patterns[cite: 157, 309].
  * [cite\_start]**Spill Confirmation & Correlation:** The system cross-references the image-based detection with the AIS data[cite: 160]. [cite\_start]If a spill is confirmed and a vessel is found to have been in the vicinity, an alert is triggered[cite: 160, 315].
  * [cite\_start]**Alert & Visualization:** The system sends immediate alerts and generates reports that can be accessed through a web dashboard, which displays the spill location, affected area, and the suspected vessel's information on an interactive map[cite: 318, 317].
