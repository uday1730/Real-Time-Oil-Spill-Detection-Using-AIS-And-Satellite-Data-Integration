# Real-Time Oil Spill Detection Using AIS and Satellite Data Integration

An automated, intelligent framework for real-time maritime surveillance, combining deep learning models with vessel tracking data to detect and report oil spills.

## üåü Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive solution to a critical environmental challenge: oil spills. Traditional detection methods are often slow and ineffective. Our system addresses these limitations by leveraging a powerful combination of technologies to provide **real-time, accurate, and automated oil spill detection** and identification of the responsible vessels.

We integrate two primary data sources:

  * **Automatic Identification System (AIS) Data:** Provides real-time vessel movement, speed, and location data. Anomalies in this data, like sudden speed drops or erratic navigation, can indicate potential spills.
  * **High-Resolution Satellite Imagery:** We use images from **Sentinel-1 (Synthetic Aperture Radar - SAR)** and **Sentinel-2** satellites, which are ideal for detecting oil slicks on the ocean surface, even in challenging weather conditions.

By fusing these data streams, our system not only detects spills but also correlates them with nearby vessel activities, a crucial step for environmental enforcement and accountability.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Real-Time Anomaly Detection:** The system continuously monitors AIS data to flag suspicious vessel behavior that may lead to an oil spill.  
* **Hybrid AI Model:** A custom-trained deep learning model, combining the strengths of **U-Net** and **DeepLabV3+** architectures, is used for precise image segmentation and spill detection.  
  * U-Net is proficient in capturing fine-grained edges and preserving spatial integrity.  
  * DeepLabV3+ excels at understanding the broader context and reducing classification errors.  
* **Data Integration & Correlation:** The integration of AIS and satellite data significantly improves the accuracy, speed, and reliability of oil spill detection.  
* **Automated Alerts & Reporting:** The system provides real-time alerts and generates visual reports with vessel identity, location coordinates, and time.  
* **Scalable Architecture:** The scalable nature of the system allows for integration with meteorological data and supports large-scale deployment by using cloud platforms like Google Earth Engine.  


## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

* **AIS Data Ingestion:** The system monitors real-time AIS data to track vessel movements.  
* **Anomaly Detection:** Machine learning algorithms are applied to detect abnormal vessel behavior, such as abrupt speed reductions or erratic navigation.  
* **Satellite Image Retrieval:** Upon detecting an anomaly, the system fetches corresponding Sentinel-1/Sentinel-2 imagery from Google Earth Engine (GEE).  
* **Deep Learning Analysis:** A custom-trained hybrid deep learning model processes the satellite image using advanced image analysis techniques, including segmentation and classification, to pinpoint suspicious surface patterns.  
* **Spill Confirmation & Correlation:** The system cross-references the image-based detection with AIS data. If a spill is confirmed and a vessel is found to have been in the vicinity, an alert is triggered.  
* **Alert & Visualization:** The system sends immediate alerts and generates reports that can be accessed through a web dashboard, which displays the spill location, affected area, and the suspected vessel's information on an interactive map.  

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.10 or higher.
  * An NVIDIA GPU is recommended for faster model training and inference.
  * A Google Earth Engine (GEE) account and API credentials.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/uday1730/Real-Time-Oil-Spill-Detection-Using-AIS-And-Satellite-Data-Integration.git
    cd Real-Time-Oil-Spill-Detection-Using-AIS-And-Satellite-Data-Integration
    ```
2.  Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Authenticate Google Earth Engine (GEE):
